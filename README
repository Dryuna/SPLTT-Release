To actually get this beast to run on your computer, you'll probably have to 
edit some of the matlab files in the config/ subdirectory.
(1) config/datapath.m should return the path where you have your videos stored.
    The path should point to a directory which includes a subdirectory for each video.
    E.g. $(datapath)/tiger2/.
    Each subdirectory should contain files with ground truth labelings and images similar
    to what MIL-Track uses. 
    As an example, see my track-data.zip file. 

Then, you "should" be able to run it with a command similar to the following:
      addpath(genpath('.')); matlab_init('coke11'); track = track_online('coke11');
